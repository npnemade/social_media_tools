# social_media_tools
This repository contains python scripts which interact with APIs from social media platforms and perform operations on the data gathered therein.
## leaderWordCount.py
This is my first experience with APIs. It is a basic tool which lists the hashtags used along with their corresponding counts in tweets from 6 world leaders.
